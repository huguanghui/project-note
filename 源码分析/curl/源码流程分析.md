## CURLcode curl_easy_perform

```c
easy_perform(easy, FALSE);->
 创建curl->multi_easy - Curl_multi_handle(1,3)
    dnscache
    sh
    conncache
	 msglist
curl_multi_add_handle(multi, data);
```

```c
  /*
   * Simply remove all expired timers from the splay since handles are dealt
   * with unconditionally by this function and curl_multi_timeout() requires
   * that already passed/handled expire times are removed from the splay.
   *
   * It is important that the 'now' value is set at the entry of this function
   * and not for the current time as it may have ticked a little while since
   * then and then we risk this loop to remove timers that actually have not
   * been handled!
   */
    multi->timetree = Curl_splaygetbest(now, multi->timetree, &t);
```
